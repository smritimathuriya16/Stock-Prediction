# Stock-Prediction
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts stock prices using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model. It leverages historical stock data from Yahoo Finance and visualizes both actual and predicted stock prices.

# Features of this project are:
1. Fetch real-time historical data using Yahoo Finance
2. Load and use a trained LSTM model for prediction
3. Scales and processes data using MinMaxScaler
4. Visualizes Actual vs Predicted stock prices
5. Easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit
